AI Future Directions Assignment
Part 1: Theoretical Analysis
Q1: Explain how Edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy compared to cloud-based AI. Provide a real-world example (e.g., autonomous drones).
Edge AI refers to deploying artificial intelligence models directly on edge devices (e.g., smartphones, IoT sensors, drones) rather than relying on cloud servers.
 Key Advantages
Reduced Latency:
In traditional cloud AI, raw data is sent to remote servers for inference, which causes delays due to network transmission. Edge AI processes data locally, ensuring instant responses.
Example: An autonomous drone detecting obstacles can’t afford cloud delays — it must process images in milliseconds to avoid collisions.
Enhanced Privacy:
Data never leaves the device; sensitive information (like faces, voices, or health data) stays local. This reduces exposure to cyber threats and compliance risks (e.g., GDPR).
 Real-World Example:
Autonomous Drones (e.g., DJI or Skydio drones):
Equipped with onboard Edge AI chips.
Use real-time object detection and navigation.
Avoids dependence on internet connectivity — crucial in disaster zones.

2. Proposed AI Model for Predicting Crop Yield (with explanation)
Recommended Model: Hybrid AI Model (LightGBM + LSTM + CNN)
A) Components
1. LightGBM (for tabular sensor data)
·        Uses soil moisture, pH, temperature, rainfall, fertilizer patterns.
·        Excellent for structured farm data.
2. LSTM (for time-series weather & sensor sequences)
·        Handles changing daily patterns:
·        Temperature shifts
·        Rainfall sequences
·        Growth cycles
·        Captures long-term dependencies → more accurate yield predictions.
3. CNN (for NDVI / RGB crop images)
·        Extracts plant health indicators from images.
·        Detects stress, pests, canopy cover, biomass.
B) Why This Hybrid Model
·        Agriculture data is multimodal → requires different models for each data type.
·        LightGBM handles noisy, incomplete environmental data very well.
·        LSTM models growth patterns that affect yield over time.
·        CNN detects real crop stress not visible in sensor data alone.
·        The combination gives higher accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.
